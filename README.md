## Getting Started

Install dependencies with the following command:

The backend is utilizing [Mongodb Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/) to host the database. After creating an account and creating a cluster following the instructions on the service.

Create an environment variable `.env` in the server directory with the following key values:

```
PORT=9000
DB_USER=<username>

SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true
```

Once your environment has been configured can seed the cluster with mock data:
